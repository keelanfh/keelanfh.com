Hi.

I'm Keelan, I'm a product manager.

I currently work for QRoutes. Before that, I worked on digital public services at Essex County Council, and on digital transport services at Transport for West Midlands.

If you want to learn more about me, check out my [Medium blog](https://keelanfh.medium.com/) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keelanfh/). You can also get in touch with me on either of those channels.
